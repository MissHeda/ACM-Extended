// explanation is ruled out by the game itself, because dialog is false for our panel, so ACE's while {dialog} do
// {closedialog 0} loop never touches it. that leaves the one thing we cannot change: ACE creates its cursormenu
// as a child of display 46, and our panel is a child of display 46 too. the map survives the same menu only
// because the map is display 12, an engine display, and is not competing for that slot.
// we cannot move our panel out of that slot, so we stop fighting it.
// the panel is not the procedure. the controls die with the display, and the procedure lives in uinamespace, as
// ACME_Thora_CutLen, cutangle and cutlocked, the placed catheters of the iv and the seal positions, and on the
// patient. the close handlers only clear transient interaction state, meaning what you were holding and whether
// the mouse was down, and that is state which should be reset anyway when a menu takes your cursor away mid-cut.
// so the display is rebuilt and the procedure is exactly where you left it. you get ACE's real menu, filtered to
// the light picker, and your incision is still open when it closes.
