// call it as [_unit, _steps, _mode] call ACME_fnc_animQueue.
// _steps is [[animation, seconds], ...] or [[animation, seconds, priority], ...]. an empty animation string is a
// pause of that length, which is how you hold a pose without re-asserting it.
// the priority is ACE's doAnimation priority and B73 DEFAULTS EVERY QUEUED STEP TO 1. Queue entries are visible
// movements between authored states, so they must follow the move graph instead of falling through to switchMove.
// A caller may still provide an explicit priority, but normal ACME treatment sequencing never requests priority 2.
// _mode is "append", the default, which queues behind whatever is already running, or "replace", which drops the
// steps that have not started yet and lets the step now playing finish first.
//
// this exists because fn_doanimheld can only hold one animation at a time. a second call takes the next
// generation and the first one stands down immediately, wherever it had got to. that is correct for a single
// pose and wrong for a sequence: chaining calls on fixed delays meant every animation was cut off by the next
// one, and whichever happened to be last is what the unit was left in.
// so the queue owns the timing. each step is handed to doanimheld with a hold equal to its own length, and the
// next step does not start until that length has elapsed.
