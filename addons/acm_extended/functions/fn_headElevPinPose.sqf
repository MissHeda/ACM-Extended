// Call it as [_unit, _seconds, _pinDir] call ACME_fnc_headElevPinPose, immediately after the animation is
// requested. It works on a casualty and on a provider.
// _pinDir is true for a casualty, whose facing must not change. It is false for a provider, who keeps the
// freedom to turn and look while the motion plays.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS.
// The BI grab and release motions move the model along the ground. A recording on 2026-09-11 measured 0.45 m of
// travel during one lay-flat motion. This function records the position and the direction at the start and writes
// them back on each frame for the given time.
//
// The pin runs for a time and not for an animation state. An earlier version stopped when the state changed, and
// the state changed one frame in, so the pin stopped before the motion that moves the body.
// It writes to the unit only and broadcasts nothing. The engine replicates the position of a local unit.
//
// The provider needs this as much as the casualty does. The drag pickup RTM is authored with the provider taking
// a step back as they take the weight, and that step moves the player away from the casualty.
