/* Convert a drawable ACM medication container classname back to its medication key without assuming ACM_ vs ACME_.
   B42 keeps the complete medication suffix rather than selecting one underscore-delimited token. That matters for
   medication keys that contain underscores, and it also preserves ACM's legacy Dimercaprol ampule, which inherits
   ACM_isVial = 1 even though its physical class is ACM_Ampule_Dimercaprol rather than ACM_Vial_*.
