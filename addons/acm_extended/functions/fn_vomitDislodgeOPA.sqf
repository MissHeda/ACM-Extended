// vomit dislodges an OPA.
// an oropharyngeal airway sits loose in the mouth, held only by the flange against the lips. it is not cuffed and
// it seals nothing. a casualty who vomits pushes it straight back out, which is exactly why an OPA does not
// protect an airway and an ETT does.
// ACM already encodes half of this: its vomit handler treats an SGA as keepAirwayIntact and leaves the airway
// alone, and an OPA gets no such protection, so the patient ends up obstructed with a useless piece of plastic
// still recorded as being in place.
// this watches the vomit obstruction level for any rise, whatever caused it, and drops the OPA when it happens. it
// is written as a watcher on the state rather than as a hook into the places that trigger vomiting, so it catches
// every source at once: our own gag-on-intubation, ACM's recurring vomit pfh, and anything added later. there is
// no way to trigger a vomit that this does not see.
// the i-gel is deliberately not removed. it is a supraglottic seal and ACM already treats it as protecting the
// airway through a vomit, so pulling it would contradict the parent mod. the NPA is left alone too, because it
// sits in the nose rather than in the path the vomit takes.
// call it as [_patient] call ACME_fnc_vomitDislodgeOPA.
